:bar_chart: UI tests for Mozilla [Redash][redash]

## Description

[Redash][redash] is a open source web-application for working with data.
Users can query data from different sources, create visualizations and
dashboards, and share them in their organization. Please check out the
[knowledge base][redash help] for more info about the Redash project.

The **redash-ui-tests** project is a community effort to develop automated UI
tests for Redash. We want to be able to automatically detect UI regressions
in release candidates and reduce the time spent on manual testing. We will
gradually add more UI tests for functionality, that is important to our
users. Check out the [tests issue label][tests] to get an idea about test cases
that we are planning to automate.

Please check out the [documentation][docs] for more information! :memo:
