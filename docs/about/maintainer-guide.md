# Maintainer Guide

## Process: [Pull Requests][pull requests]

If a pull request is untriaged:

- Add a reference to any [related issues][issues]
- Add a [milestone][milestones], if it makes sense
- Add relevant [labels][labels]

Reviewing pull requests:

Code reviews are a great tool for sharing knowledge in the team and making
sure that new code meets our standards for code readability and
comprehensibility.

- Check that there is an open issue for any new `TODO` comments
- Make sure the pull request passes tests and code checks on CI
- Be extra careful about API breaking changes

Merging pull requests:

- Every pull request needs to go through code review and at least one
approval from a maintainer
- This also applies to pull requests from maintainers!
- Add the author's info to our [community page][community]
- Make sure to thank them for their contribution to **redash-ui-tests**! ðŸ“Š
